### Hadith Daily

"Hadith Daily" is an application designed to provide users with a daily dose of beautiful Hadiths (sayings and actions of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him). The purpose of this app is to help users stay connected to the teachings of Islam and derive spiritual inspiration from the timeless wisdom contained in the Hadith literature.

The app allows users to register and create an account. Once registered, users will receive an email every day at 7 AM containing a randomly selected Hadith.

Each email will present a new Hadith along with its corresponding reference, enabling users to explore further if desired.

The goal of "Hadith Daily" is to promote a deeper understanding and appreciation of the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, fostering a positive impact on the lives of users. By receiving these daily reminders, users can incorporate the teachings of the Hadiths into their daily routines, reflect on their meanings, and strive to embody the virtues and values they highlight.

Through the convenience of email delivery, users can seamlessly integrate these meaningful Hadiths into their morning routine, providing spiritual nourishment and guidance throughout their day. Whether it's a short yet profound saying or an inspiring anecdote from the life of the Prophet Muhammad(peace be upon him), each Hadith is carefully chosen to uplift and enlighten the hearts and minds of users.

By delivering Hadiths straight to their inbox, "Hadith Daily" aims to serve as a valuable resource for individuals seeking spiritual growth, knowledge, and a stronger connection to their faith. It is an app that encourages users to embark on a journey of self-improvement, fostering a deeper understanding of Islam's teachings and their practical application in everyday life.

Ultimately, "Hadith Daily" endeavors to create a positive impact by spreading the beautiful teachings of the Prophet Muhammad(peace be upon him) and nurturing a community of individuals who seek to align their lives with the principles of Islam.
